VX Module Toolkit
-----------------

The VX Module Toolkit is a C library implementing a fast and flexible 
interface to a wide range of VX modules.

It is a work in progress and should be considered ALPHA quality code at 
this time.  Nothing is guaranteed to work.

See INSTALL.txt for installation instructions.

Latest Updates: 

- Compiling cleanly on 64 bit OSX (Snow Leopard) and 32 bit Linux (Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS Lucid Lynx).  All tests pass.
